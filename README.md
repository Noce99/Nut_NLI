For a full training session please run:

```
python train.py

Before training you need to download all the datasets: [SNLI](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/), [MNLI](https://cims.nyu.edu/~sbowman/multinli/), [FEVER](https://fever.ai/dataset/fever.html), [ANLI](https://github.com/facebookresearch/anli) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/contradictory-my-dear-watson/data). Otherwise you can find them already unified by me [there](https://mega.nz/folder/WQ5BHZ5S#DiG1el9jbfNASEL7yTwjHw).
